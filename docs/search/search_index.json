If not, switch it on by clicking the toggle button. You may be prompted to restart your computer after enabling Developer Mode.</p> <p>Step 2: Enable Virtual Machine Platform feature (Optional) This step ensures a smoother installation process for WSL2 and is recommended if you are using Windows build 19041 or later, which comes with the May 2020 Update (version 2004). To enable this feature:</p> <p>Press Win + X and select \"Windows PowerShell (Admin)\" from the menu that appears. This will open a new Windows PowerShell window with admin privileges.</p> <p>In the PowerShell window, run the following command to enable the Virtual Machine Platform feature: </p><pre><code>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform -All\n</code></pre> Restart your computer after enabling the Virtual Machine Platform feature if prompted. <p>Step 3: Install WSL2</p> <p>Open a Windows PowerShell with administrative privileges as described in step 2 of Step 2.</p> <p>Run the following command to enable the WSL2 Linux kernel feature (this is only required for versions prior to Windows build 19041):</p> <pre><code>dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n</code></pre> <p>Restart your computer when prompted. After the restart, open a PowerShell window again with administrative privileges and run these commands to install WSL2:</p> <pre><code>wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04\n</code></pre> <p>Step 4: Set up default user for Ubuntu on WSL2 After installing the Ubuntu distribution, you may want to create a new user account within it and set it as your default user. Here's how to do this:</p> <p>Launch the Ubuntu distribution by typing wsl in the Windows search bar or running the command  </p><pre><code>wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04\n</code></pre> <p>Once you are logged into the Ubuntu environment, open a terminal window and run these commands to create a new user account: </p><pre><code>sudo adduser unovie\n</code></pre> <p>Set your default password during the username creation process. After creating the user, log out from your current session (you can do this by typing exit or pressing Ctrl + D), and then run the following command to set it as your default Ubuntu user: </p><pre><code>wsl --set-default-user unovie -d Ubuntu-24.04\n</code></pre> <p>Now, every time you launch WSL with wsl or from the Windows search bar, you'll be logged in to your new user account by default.</p> <p>Step 5: Update and upgrade packages Once you have set up Ubuntu on WSL2, it is a good idea to update and upgrade all installed packages to ensure that everything is running smoothly:</p> <p>Run the following commands in the Ubuntu terminal window to update your package lists and then install any available updates: </p><pre><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\n</code></pre> <p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed WSL2 with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on Windows 10, and you can now start using the Linux environment right from your Windows machine.</p>"},{"location":"setup/wsl2-sandbox/#windows-terminal","title":"Windows Terminal","text":"<p>Install Windows Terminal which allows you to work with WSL2 easily </p> <p>Follow this link to install https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US</p>"},{"location":"setup/wsl2-sandbox/#install-sandbox-packages","title":"Install Sandbox Packages","text":"<p>In terminal execute the following script </p> <pre><code>apt-get -y install curl\nclear\nbash &lt;(curl -s https://unovie.ai/docs/assets/sandbox.sh)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"training/about-unovie/","title":"About unovie","text":""},{"location":"training/about-unovie/#about-unovie","title":"About Unovie","text":"<p>Welcome to Unovie, AI platform for Edge. </p> <p>Unovie Mission : </p> <ul> <li>Apply AI to Edge use-cases in real-world where latency and decision taking is near real-time (less than 30sec)</li> <li>In-line with Stream Processing of Data NOT Batch Processing</li> <li>Have capability to AI-Mesh of sharing the limited GPU resources (Similar to Apple Intelligence)</li> <li>Solid Engineering Skills to help customers solve business problems with end-to-end design, build, operate projects at large scale.</li> <li>Extreme Automation and Laser focused project delivery within fixed time and fixed costs.</li> </ul> <p>Some important links you need to aware of</p> <ul> <li>Blogs : Unovie Blogs  have important public facing innovation ideas distilled to non-technical users.</li> <li>Apple Intelligence has been captured in blog and highlights the on-device processing, tensor parallelism, model co-processing </li> </ul> <p>Unovie Introduction </p>"},{"location":"training/ai-evolution/","title":"Ai evolution","text":""},{"location":"training/ai-evolution/#tracking-the-ai-evolution","title":"Tracking the AI Evolution","text":"<p>Knowledge in itself is a incremental evolution of foundational things set before</p> <p>Like evolution of DNA which has fine-tunes itself over millions of years to be what it is.  example my Dog Jasmine learnt that giving love and loyalty means good food and happy life.</p>"},{"location":"training/ai-evolution/#ai-evolution","title":"AI Evolution.","text":"<ul> <li> <p>AI had lot of false starts, since early 2000's their have been various things attempted and failed miserably.
